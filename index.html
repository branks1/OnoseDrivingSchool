						“I had a nice time at Onose Driving School. I am new to driving, so they took me by the hand every step of the way. The whole process was quite fun too, even the classroom sessions were entertaining as well as educative. I know so much right now.  The in-car sessions were my favorite though, I was quite nervous at the start, but over time I grew into a confident driver. All thanks to Onose Driving School. I passed the driver’s license test on my first try! Never thought I would.”<br /><span class="test-name">-	Tony Ukaegbu</span>
